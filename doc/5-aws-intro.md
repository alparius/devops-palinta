Main purpose of this exercise to understand the basics of AWS.

> Check AWS fozocske on EDU git.
> You can follow the videos: check git repo for location.

> Each step is described in the CS training pdf or videos.
> Estimated time: 3.5h for the videos

The described steps are a simple walk through on the training videos.

## Step 1: Log in

- Into AWS console
- Into AWS CLI

## Step 2: Create VPC

## Step 3: Create an EC2

Create a new EC2 instance (use free tier version). Install nginx.

- Instances and AMIs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instances-and-amis.html

## Step 4: Create a rule to access S3 from EC2 instance

## Step 5: Create a new lambda function

## Step 6: Create an API gateway

## Step 7: Deploy a serverless website to S3

## Step 8: Connect website with deployed lambda function

## Optional: Step 9: Try out different lambda template (Ex. Python, Go, Java, etc.)

## Optional: Step 10: Use the force Luke (CLI)
